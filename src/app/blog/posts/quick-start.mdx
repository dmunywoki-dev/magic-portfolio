## About

I built this portfolio to tell my story — not just through words, but through real, working systems.  
Over the last few years, I’ve helped design and develop platforms that power Kenya’s innovation, transparency, and safety — from the **Public Procurement Information Portal (PPIP)** to **SafeBus**, an IoT-powered school transport system.

This site is my way of bringing all that work together.  
It’s a dynamic, MDX-based portfolio built with **Once UI** and **Next.js**, designed to be responsive, SEO-friendly, and easy to expand as I continue building new things.

## Inspiration

After working on large systems where every feature served a public purpose — from national data portals to e-learning and AI-driven tools — I wanted my own space that reflects that same sense of structure and intention.  
Something clean, fast, and human — like the software I aim to build.

So, I set out to create a developer portfolio that feels alive, driven by real data and purpose-driven storytelling.

## Core Stack

- **Next.js** — for performance, routing, and server-side rendering  
- **Once UI** — for a clean, minimalist, and professional interface  
- **MDX** — to write project stories in Markdown with embedded components  
- **Tailwind CSS** — for responsive design and visual consistency  
- **Vercel** — for effortless CI/CD and global deployment  

## Quick Start

If you’d like to create a similar setup for your own portfolio, here’s how I started:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "git clone https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-portfolio.git",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Install dependencies:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm install",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Run the local development server:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm run dev",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

## Reflection

This portfolio is more than just a place to list skills — it’s my digital narrative.  
Each project here represents a challenge I’ve faced and a lesson I’ve learned: from **integrating IoT in school buses**, to **building national transparency platforms**, to **engineering e-commerce systems** that make wellness accessible online.

As I continue pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science and Analytics**, I see this platform as a living space to explore new ideas — where technology meets storytelling, and code meets purpose.
