## Overview

The Public Procurement Information Portal (PPIP) is a national digital platform designed to promote accountability in Kenya’s public procurement ecosystem. As part of the core development team at @iLabAfrica, I was involved from inception through deployment.

## Key Features

- **Procurement Data Publication:** Enables government agencies to upload and publish procurement data for public access.  
- **Powerful Search & Filtering:** Allows users to easily find tenders, contracts, and suppliers.  
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Offers real-time insights and statistics on national procurement trends.  
- **API Integrations:** Provides open data endpoints for third-party developers and watchdog organizations.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Laravel, MySQL, PHP  
- **Frontend:** Vue.js, Bootstrap  
- **Infrastructure:** Ubuntu Server, Nginx  
- **Version Control & CI/CD:** Git, Jenkins

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing data transparency with security was critical. I implemented access controls and encryption to ensure compliance with Kenya’s data protection laws while maintaining openness for public use.

## Outcome

PPIP has significantly improved accessibility to public procurement data and is used nationwide by both citizens and institutions to promote fair tendering practices.
