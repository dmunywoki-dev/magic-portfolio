## Overview

Focusing on food security, this project involves deploying low-cost sensors to measure soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, transmitting data to a cloud platform for analysis and automated irrigation control.

## Key Features

- **Sensor Integration:** Support for moisture, pH, and temperature sensors.
- **Automated Irrigation:** Triggers water systems based on sensor thresholds.
- **Mobile Alerts:** SMS and push notifications for critical conditions.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware:** ESP32, Raspberry Pi
- **Connectivity:** MQTT, LoRaWAN
- **Platform:** Node.js, InfluxDB, Grafana

## Outcome

Expected to increase crop yield by optimizing resource usage and reducing water waste for small-scale farmers.
