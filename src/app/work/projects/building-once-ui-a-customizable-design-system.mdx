## Overview

SafeBus is an IoT-based school transport management system designed to keep students safe and parents informed. By integrating RFID scanners, GPS tracking, and real-time notifications, the platform provides schools and guardians with complete visibility into student commute activities.

## Key Features

- **RFID-Driven Attendance:** Tracks when students board or alight from the bus, automatically updating attendance logs.
- **Parent Notifications:** Sends instant alerts to parents when their child gets on or off the bus.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Offers insights on bus routes, trip history, and student safety metrics.
- **Payment Integration:** Seamlessly links to school fee systems, streamlining billing and accountability.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **IoT Layer:** Raspberry Pi + RFID Readers  
- **Cloud & Hosting:** AWS + Nginx  
- **APIs:** Twilio, Firebase Notifications

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating physical IoT devices with live web systems required robust error handling and network resilience. I implemented fallback queues and caching mechanisms to handle signal loss, ensuring system reliability even in remote areas.

## Outcome

SafeBus transformed how schools track and communicate transport activities, improving safety and accountability. The platform continues to evolve with data-driven features such as predictive route optimization and AI-based safety analytics.
