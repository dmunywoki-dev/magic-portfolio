## Overview

This upcoming project aims to tackle Nairobi's traffic congestion by utilizing real-time camera feeds and machine learning algorithms to optimize traffic light timings dynamically.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Analysis:** Computer vision models to count vehicles and estimate wait times.
- **Dynamic Signal Control:** Adaptive traffic light algorithms based on current traffic density.
- **Dashboard:** A central command interface for city planners to monitor traffic flow.

## Technologies Used

- **ML/AI:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Frontend:** React, Mapbox GL

## Outcome

The goal is to reduce average commute times by 20% and lower carbon emissions from idling vehicles.
